+ Completed technical assessment.
+ Api changes made in python.
+ I would also like to add that because of time concerns and almost zero starting knowledge of React I did not create additional tests for that portion of the app. Also because of time concerns, my python tests are not as thorough as I would normally like. They are currently only testing for success. I work mostly in Django so although I have some experience with Flask, it still brought additional challenges.
