+ Completed technical assessment.
+ Api changes made in python.
+ I would also like to add that because of time concerns and almost zero starting knowledge of React I did not create additional tests for that portion of the app. Also because of time concerns, my python tests are not as thorough as I would normally like. They are currently only testing for success. I work mostly in Django so although I have some experience with Flask, it still brought additional challenges. 
+ I've added improved modularity for both the Flask and React elements as well as related additional testing for the Flask app. Again, I have not added tests for React because of time concerns. Please let me know if you would like me to add tests in React.
